# Machine-Learning
I have done some machine learning projects:
1. Analyze S&P 500 returns by LSTM
2. Predict price directions of SPY
3. Fit ARIMA models on the DailyRet time series
4. Using logistic model to predict Survival on Titanic Problems
5. Using random forest model to predict credit risk

I have uploaded pdf and jupyter notebooks of my projects.

Thanks for your reviewing!
